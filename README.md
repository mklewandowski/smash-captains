# Smash Captains
Smash Captains is a biplane-themed race game. It's filled with inspirations ranging from classic console games like Barnstorming and Looping to modern casual mobile games like Crossy Road. Ultimately I wanted to make a game that was designed for speedrunning and that used a voxel art visual style (so I could get my hands dirty with Magicavoxel and make something in 3D). I landed on Smash Captains after binging speedrun videos of Barnstorming on the Atari 2600. I wanted to do something similar but in a modern voxel style.
